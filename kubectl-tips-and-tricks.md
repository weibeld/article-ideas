Part 2 of the infamous "Boosting your kubectl productivity" article.

## Content

- Display help and `kubectl explain` output in terminal pager (`less`) by default
- Auto-generate resource manifests with `kubectl run --dry-run`
    - For example, `kubectl run test --image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml` outputs the manifest of the Deployment that would be created with the `kubectl run` command. You can save this output to a file and use it as a starting point for customising the resource definition.
    - The `kubectl run` command can create Deployments, Jobs, and Pods (differentiated by the value of the `--restart` option), as well as Services (when the `--expose` option is present).
