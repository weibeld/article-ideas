Tutorial-like walk-trough for defining permissions for AWS Lambda functions in SAM and CloudFormation definitions.

## Remarks

- Fairly advanced Medium draft from 2018 exists (see below)

> TODO: refactor this article to define a specific Lambda function with a specific permission set in SAM, CloudFormation, and Terraform?
